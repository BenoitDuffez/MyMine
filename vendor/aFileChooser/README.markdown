# aFileChooser - Android File Chooser

*(Complete rewrite 10/30/2012)*

Android developers often desire a way to present a user with a method of selecting a file from "external" storage. Android's `Intent` system gives developers the ability to implicitly hook into other app's components, but if the user doesn't have a file explorer installed, the developer must instruct them to install one, or build one, themselves. 

aFileChooser is an __Android Library Project__ that simplifies this process.

### Features:

 * Provides a built-in file explorer
 * Streamlines the `Intent.ACTION_GET_CONTENT` Intent calling process
 * Easily convert a URI into s java `File` object
 * Determine MIME data types
 * Follows Android conventions (Fragments, Loaders) and is extremely simple to implement

## Installation

Add aFileChooser to your project as an Android Library Project. If you are unfamiliar with Android Library Projects, refer to the official documentation [here](http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/projects/projects-eclipse.html#ReferencingLibraryProject).

Add FileChooserActivity to your project's AndroidManifest.xml file. The `android:label` and `android:icon` are displayed in the Action Chooser Dialog.

__Important__ It must have the `intent-filter` set as seen bellow:

    <activity
        android:name="com.ipaulpro.afilechooser.FileChooserActivity"
        android:icon="@drawable/ic_chooser"
        android:label="@string/choose_file" >
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="android.intent.action.GET_CONTENT" />

                <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.OPENABLE" />

                <data android:mimeType="*/*" />
            </intent-filter>
        </activity>

## Usage

aFileChooser uses `startActivityForResult` to return the Uri of the file selected. The `FileUtils` class provides a helper method to construct an `ACTION_GET_CONTENT` Intent that can be used to create the Action Chooser Dialog. 

    private static final int REQUEST_CODE = 1234;
    private static final String CHOOSER_TITLE = "Select a file";

    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

        Intent target = FileUtils.createGetContentIntent();
        Intent intent = Intent.createChooser(target, CHOOSER_TITLE);
        try {
            startActivityForResult(intent, REQUEST_CODE);
        } catch (ActivityNotFoundException e) {
            // The reason for the existence of aFileChooser
        }
    }

    @Override
    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
        switch (requestCode) {
        case REQUEST_CODE:	
            if (resultCode == RESULT_OK) {	
                // The URI of the selected file	
                final Uri uri = data.getData();
                // Create a File from this Uri
                File file = FileUtils.getFile(uri);
            }
        }
    }

A more robust example can be found in the aFileChooserExample folder.
